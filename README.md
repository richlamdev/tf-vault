# development / testing with HashiCorp Vault.

## Requirements:

Based on the github modules located here:

https://github.com/TerryHowe/ansible-modules-hashivault

### Notes:

These are horrible practices here.  Not meant for production at all.  (unseal and root tokens saved to local disk)

This is meant purely to learn/practice with vault with an ephemeral instance.  (an alternative, use dev mode locally to practice with HashiCorp Vault)
